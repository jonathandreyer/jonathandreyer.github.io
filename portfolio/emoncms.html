				<p><b>Goal:</b> Home consumption live monitoring. The metering is done from information gathered from the different meters (electricity, gas and water). It is also interesting to be able to follow the energy consumption of the heating in order to measure its energy efficiency. An acquisition module needs to be developed and to be able to transmit information to a server. This project is based on the emonCMS software.</p>

				<p><b>On going:</b> The acquisition board is being developed. A first and simplified version is functional with an Arduino Yùn allowing the server-side to be tested.</p>

				<p><b>Partial result:</b> The server-side is functional. It is currently being tested which allows us to gather different information related to the electric consumption. It makes possible to make the load profile of two apartments with solar production.</p>

				<p><b>Technologies:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Arduino Yùn (Prototyping)</li>
						<li>FreeRTOS (Open source)</li>
						<li>STM32F407 (high end microprocessor)</li>
						<li>emonCMS (Open source)</li>
					</ul>
