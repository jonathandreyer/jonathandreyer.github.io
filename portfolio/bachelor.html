				<p><b>Description:</b> On an assembly line in automation, it is often necessary to bring parts in order to assembly them. Currently, there are two different types of feeder parts. The cheapest version uses a vibratory bowl feeder but is limited to one part chosen in advance. The second type uses a flexible feeder coupled with an industrial smart camera and a manipulating robot.<br>
					This project aims at realizing a flexible feeder's control system and thus replacing a smart camera from the market. This smart element allows to manage the flexible feeder as well as the robot.<br>
					By replacing the smart camera by a computer associated with an industrial vision, it is possible to cut costs. This solution allows to use vision at a better price and to reduce in fine the price of the vision in this type of application with a factor of 3 to 6.<br>
					The final goal of this project is to create a technology demonstration capable of quickly adapting itself to new types of pieces.</p>
				
				<p><b>Results:</b> This software developed to drive a flexible part feeding can easily adapt itself to new types of parts as well as to the modification of the code. Currently the setting and the learning of a new part is done by editing some text files. The graphical interface summarizes properly the process and the interaction with the program is straightforward.</p>
				
				<p><b>Perspectives:</b> The industrialization of this project will offer simplifications in learning the model and the settings related to the vision. This part could not be implemented but it is an essential element in order to make this new solution, as well as its setting, easy to use.</p>
				
				<p><b>Technologies:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Matrox Imaging Library (competitive price)</li>
						<li>C# programming (easy memory management)</li>
						<li>MahApps.Metro (UI metro style)</li>
					</ul>
